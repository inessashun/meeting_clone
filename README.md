**Schedule of Meetings** means the Board 
and Committee *meeting calendar* approved 
at the ***Organizational Meeting***, 
or as may be amended by the Board from time to time. 

Tips for Finding a Meeting Time That Works for Everyone

- Provide meeting details.
- Prepare an agenda.
- Communicate value.
- Determine the meeting type.
   - Consider all time zones.
   - Schedule the meeting in advance.
  
Block off **'no meeting'** time on your calendar.

Don't schedule a meeting when <br/> 
an ***MEETENG REMINDER*** will do.
